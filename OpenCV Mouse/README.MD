# Hand Tracking Mouse Control: A Simpler Explanation

This Python script lets you use your hand to control your computer's mouse and click, all through your webcam. It watches your hand move and turns those movements into actions on your screen.

## How It Works: The Basics

Here's a simplified look at how the script does its job:

1.  **Sees Your Hand (OpenCV):** Your webcam sends live video to the script, like its eyes.
2.  **Finds Your Hand (MediaPipe):** Special computer smarts find your hand in the video and spots key points, like your fingertips.
3.  **Checks Your Fingers (Distance):** The script measures how close your index finger and thumb are.
4.  **Moves the Mouse (PyAutoGUI):** If your index finger moves while your thumb is further away, the mouse cursor on your screen moves too.
5.  **Clicks the Mouse (PyAutoGUI):** If you bring your index finger and thumb close together, it's like a mouse click. You need to separate them before you can click again.

## Things to Keep in Mind

-   **Good Lighting:** The script works best when there's enough light.
-   **Clear View:** Make sure the camera can see your whole hand clearly.
-   **Distance Matters:** Keep your hand at a reasonable distance from the camera.
-   **Computer Power:** The script needs some computer power to run smoothly.
