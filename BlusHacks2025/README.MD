# Insight HQ - Hackathon Project: Customer Sentiment Analysis for Business Growth

This repository showcases the website we developed for our hackathon project, "Insight HQ." This project aims to provide businesses with valuable insights into customer feedback through sentiment analysis of reviews.

## Project Overview

Insight HQ is designed to help businesses understand what their customers are saying. By analyzing customer reviews, our platform identifies positive and negative sentiments, providing actionable feedback to improve customer satisfaction and business operations.

## Key Features

-   **Customer Review Analysis:** Insight HQ aggregates and analyzes customer reviews from various sources.
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of customer feedback (positive, negative, neutral).
-   **Key Feedback Identification:** Extracts key topics and areas of concern or appreciation from customer reviews.
-   **Actionable Insights:** Presents feedback in a clear, concise manner, enabling businesses to understand and address customer needs.
-   **Website Overview:** The website we created for the hackathon serves as a demonstration of the Insight HQ concept and its key features.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML:** For structuring the website content and layout.
-   **CSS:** For styling the website and creating a user-friendly interface.
-   **(Conceptual) Sentiment Analysis:** While the website focuses on the UI, the project concept incorporates sentiment analysis, which would typically involve technologies like Python with libraries such as NLTK or TextBlob, or cloud-based sentiment analysis APIs.

## File Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website overview.
-   `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
-   `graph.png`: Example graph/chart image.
-   Team member images (`nikhi.jpg`, `arni.jpg`, `lalu.jpg`, `adi.jpg`).

## How it Works (Conceptual)

1.  **Review Collection:** Insight HQ would gather customer reviews from various online platforms.
2.  **Sentiment Processing:** The reviews are processed using sentiment analysis algorithms to determine the emotional tone.
3.  **Topic Extraction:** Key topics and recurring themes in the reviews are identified.
4.  **Feedback Presentation:** The analyzed data is presented in an easy-to-understand format, highlighting positive and negative feedback areas.

## Website Purpose

The website serves as a visual demonstration of the Insight HQ concept, showcasing how the platform would present analyzed customer feedback to businesses.

## Team and Development

This project was developed by a team of friends during a hackathon. The "Meet The Devs!" section on the website highlights our team.

## Usage (For Inspiration/Presentation)

This project can be used as a demonstration of a sentiment analysis tool for customer feedback, or as inspiration for future development.

## Future Development (Conceptual)

For a fully functional Insight HQ, future development would involve:

-   Implementing backend logic for data collection and analysis.
-   Integrating sentiment analysis APIs or libraries.
-   Developing a robust dashboard for data visualization.
-   Adding user authentication and data management features.
